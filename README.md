I successfully created and trained a Machine Learning regression model with 186,369 parameters to predict the water purity based on 26 distinct features. This project was undertaken as part of a Kaggle competition hosted by Growth Jockey Pvt. Ltd. The model training took place on the Kaggle  platform. The competition's evaluation criterion was the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE). Both the training and test datasets were provided by the organizers. I achieved an impressive test accuracy of 0.22, resulting in third rank to finish the competition.
